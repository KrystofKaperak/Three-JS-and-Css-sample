[{"title":"The Shins : The Rifle's Spiral","description":"Here is our stop motion film for THE SHINS track: The Rifle's Spiral. \n\nThe film mixes traditional puppet animation with 2D paper hinged animation.  It was shot at our stages in Ojai CA. We shot with the Canon 5D, and 7D and 60D using Dragonframe software. For moving shots we used a rig called the Volo by ARC Motion Control (arcmoco.com). We also used a nice camera slider by Dito Gear. \n\n\nCredits:\n\nDirection: Jamie Caliri\nProduction Designer / Co-Director: Alexander Juhasz\nCo-Producer:  Matthew Manning\nEditor: Steve Beebe\nLead Animator: Anthony Scott\nAnimators: Matt Manning, Mike Johnson, Rachel Larsen, Kent Burton, Rich Zimmerman\nPost Production Supervisor: Damien Christian D’Amico\nPuppet Fabrication: Pablo Grande Weiss, Yoriko Murakami, Robyn Yannoukos\nScenic Artist: Vera Long\nProp Artist: Kristen Droney\nSet Designer: Neva Williams\nProduction Manager: Elyse Kelly, Susan Bell\nStage Manager: Matthew Manning","thumbnails":{"default":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/285/720/285720731_100.jpg","medium":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/285/720/285720731_200.jpg","high":"http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/285/720/285720731_640.jpg"},"embedUrl":"http://player.vimeo.com/video/41266095","videoUrl":"http://vimeo.com/41266095"},{"title":"The Rifles -
